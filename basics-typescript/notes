install package.json: npm init -y
installation: npm install typescript
installation globally: npm install -g typescript

ts does not run in browser hence we need to install compiler
compiler installation: npx tsc | Will give error cause we need ts configuartion file 
compiler installation specific file: npx tsc filename.ts | Will give error cause we need ts configuartion file 
After compiling it will automatically create a filename.js and convert out typescript file to javascript
